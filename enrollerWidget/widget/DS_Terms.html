            <span class="s1">The "Facility" means the organisation providing the service for which the Customer is paying. The "Customer"
                means the person or party authorising this Contract. "Debitsuccess" is Debitsuccess Pty Limited, PO Box 577,

        <p class="p2">
            <span class="s1">The Customer agrees to pay the instalment amount at the agreed payment frequency until this Contract is terminated
                in accordance with clause 4 below. Should there be any arrears in payments the Customer authorises Debitsuccess
                to debit the outstanding balance in order to bring the account up to date.</span>

            </span>
        </p>
        <p class="p2">
            <span class="s1">The Customer may terminate this Contract before the expiry of the minimum term or payments if all the instalments
                and fees due up to the date of termination are paid, and in addition the cancellation fee as specified on
                the front of this Contract is paid to Debitsuccess. Should the membership type selected as part of this online
                signup be indicated as ongoing in nature, then this Contract shall continue indefinitely after the minimum
                term until such time as the Customer requests Debitsuccess, after the expiry of the minimum term for it to
                terminate. Any instalments/fees due at the date of termination (including instalments/fees which fall due
                during the notice period) will remain a debt owed to and recoverable by Debitsuccess. There will be a period
                of notice of 30 days unless otherwise specified by the Facility between the date of request and the date
                of actual termination during which any payments due must still be paid in full. The Customer should contact
                Debitsuccess if they have not received written confirmation of the termination within the 30 day period.
                The Customer shall not consider that this contract has been terminated until such time as this is confirmed
                in writing to the Customer by Debitsuccess (not more than 14 days after the termination date). Termination
                of this Contract will also terminate the Direct Debit Request Authority.</span>
